# My Portfolio Site
My portfolio site to showcase my projects and what I'm currently working on

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Netlify

I will be showcasing some of my more robust projects on this site, but the site itself is a simple static site, just enough to get the message across!

## Lessons Learned:

I had never used Netlify and GitHub in combination to deploy a project before, and I wanted to check it out, as I'm starting to use GitHub to post all of my projects. I think I might continue using it, as I think it makes version control very simple for these simple projects.
